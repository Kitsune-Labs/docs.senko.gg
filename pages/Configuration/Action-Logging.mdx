# Action Logging

<Callout type="warning">
	Senko will need the "View Audit Log" permission to log actions she did not make.
</Callout>

Create your channel you want to log actions in. You can name it whatever you want, but we recommended to name it something like `action-logs` for easy visibility.

> The channel we created
![Action log channel](https://klabsrg1.blob.core.windows.net/public/docs/action_logs_channel.png)
---
Now we will tell Senko to use the channel using the command `/server action-logs set`

> Example response from Senko
![Action log channel set](https://klabsrg1.blob.core.windows.net/public/docs/action_report_set.png)
---
Now when a member gets banned, kicked, or timed-out, Senko will send a message to the channel notifying you of the action.

> Example of a member being banned
